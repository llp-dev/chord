# Module `memchr`

Provides architecture independent implementations of `memchr` and friends.

The main types in this module are [`One`](#one), [`Two`](#two) and [`Three`](#three). They are for
searching for one, two or three distinct bytes, respectively, in a haystack.
Each type also has corresponding double ended iterators. These searchers
are typically slower than hand-coded vector routines accomplishing the same
task, but are also typically faster than naive scalar code. These routines
effectively work by treating a `usize` as a vector of 8-bit lanes, and thus
achieves some level of data parallelism even without explicit vector support.

The `One` searcher also provides a `One::count` routine for efficiently
counting the number of times a single byte occurs in a haystack. This is
useful, for example, for counting the number of lines in a haystack. This
routine exists because it is usually faster, especially with a high match
count, than using `One::find` repeatedly. ([`OneIter`](#oneiter) specializes its
`Iterator::count` implementation to use this routine.)

Only one, two and three bytes are supported because three bytes is about
the point where one sees diminishing returns. Beyond this point and it's
probably (but not necessarily) better to just use a simple `[bool; 256]` array
or similar. However, it depends mightily on the specific work-load and the
expected match frequency.

## Structs

### `One`

```rust
struct One {
    s1: u8,
    v1: usize,
}
```

Finds all occurrences of a single byte in a haystack.

#### Implementations

- <span id="one-const-loop-bytes"></span>`const LOOP_BYTES: usize`

- <span id="one-new"></span>`fn new(needle: u8) -> One` — [`One`](#one)

  Create a new searcher that finds occurrences of the byte given.

- <span id="one-find"></span>`fn find(&self, haystack: &[u8]) -> Option<usize>`

  Return the first occurrence of the needle in the given haystack. If no

  such occurrence exists, then `None` is returned.

  

  The occurrence is reported as an offset into `haystack`. Its maximum

  value for a non-empty haystack is `haystack.len() - 1`.

- <span id="one-rfind"></span>`fn rfind(&self, haystack: &[u8]) -> Option<usize>`

  Return the last occurrence of the needle in the given haystack. If no

  such occurrence exists, then `None` is returned.

  

  The occurrence is reported as an offset into `haystack`. Its maximum

  value for a non-empty haystack is `haystack.len() - 1`.

- <span id="one-count"></span>`fn count(&self, haystack: &[u8]) -> usize`

  Counts all occurrences of this byte in the given haystack.

- <span id="one-find-raw"></span>`unsafe fn find_raw(&self, start: *const u8, end: *const u8) -> Option<*const u8>`

  Like `find`, but accepts and returns raw pointers.

  

  When a match is found, the pointer returned is guaranteed to be

  `>= start` and `< end`.

  

  This routine is useful if you're already using raw pointers and would

  like to avoid converting back to a slice before executing a search.

  

  # Safety

  

  * Both `start` and `end` must be valid for reads.

  * Both `start` and `end` must point to an initialized value.

  * Both `start` and `end` must point to the same allocated object and

  must either be in bounds or at most one byte past the end of the

  allocated object.

  * Both `start` and `end` must be _derived from_ a pointer to the same

  object.

  * The distance between `start` and `end` must not overflow `isize`.

  * The distance being in bounds must not rely on "wrapping around" the

  address space.

  

  Note that callers may pass a pair of pointers such that `start >= end`.

  In that case, `None` will always be returned.

- <span id="one-rfind-raw"></span>`unsafe fn rfind_raw(&self, start: *const u8, end: *const u8) -> Option<*const u8>`

  Like `rfind`, but accepts and returns raw pointers.

  

  When a match is found, the pointer returned is guaranteed to be

  `>= start` and `< end`.

  

  This routine is useful if you're already using raw pointers and would

  like to avoid converting back to a slice before executing a search.

  

  # Safety

  allocated object.

  object.

  * The distance between `start` and `end` must not overflow `isize`.

  * The distance being in bounds must not rely on "wrapping around" the

  address space.

  

  Note that callers may pass a pair of pointers such that `start >= end`.

  In that case, `None` will always be returned.

- <span id="one-count-raw"></span>`unsafe fn count_raw(&self, start: *const u8, end: *const u8) -> usize`

  Counts all occurrences of this byte in the given haystack represented

  by raw pointers.

  

  This routine is useful if you're already using raw pointers and would

  like to avoid converting back to a slice before executing a search.

  

  # Safety

  

  * Both `start` and `end` must be valid for reads.

  * Both `start` and `end` must point to an initialized value.

  * The distance being in bounds must not rely on "wrapping around" the

  address space.

  

  Note that callers may pass a pair of pointers such that `start >= end`.

  In that case, `0` will always be returned.

- <span id="one-iter"></span>`fn iter<'a, 'h>(self: &'a Self, haystack: &'h [u8]) -> OneIter<'a, 'h>` — [`OneIter`](#oneiter)

  Returns an iterator over all occurrences of the needle byte in the

  given haystack.

  

  The iterator returned implements `DoubleEndedIterator`. This means it

  can also be used to find occurrences in reverse order.

## Functions

### `has_zero_byte`

```rust
fn has_zero_byte(x: usize) -> bool
```

Return `true` if `x` contains any zero byte.

That is, this routine treats `x` as a register of 8-bit lanes and returns
true when any of those lanes is `0`.

From "Matters Computational" by J. Arndt.

### `splat`

```rust
const fn splat(b: u8) -> usize
```

Repeat the given byte into a word size number. That is, every 8 bits
is equivalent to the given byte. For example, if `b` is `\x4E` or
`01001110` in binary, then the returned value on a 32-bit system would be:
`01001110_01001110_01001110_01001110`.

## Constants

### `USIZE_BYTES`
```rust
const USIZE_BYTES: usize = 8usize;
```

The number of bytes in a single `usize` value.

### `USIZE_ALIGN`
```rust
const USIZE_ALIGN: usize = 7usize;
```

The bits that must be zero for a `*const usize` to be properly aligned.
