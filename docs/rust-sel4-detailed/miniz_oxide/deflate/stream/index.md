# Module `stream`

Extra streaming compression functionality.

As of now this is mainly intended for use to build a higher-level wrapper.

There is no DeflateState as the needed state is contained in the compressor struct itself.

## Quick Reference

| Item | Kind | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| [`deflate`](#deflate) | fn | Try to compress from input to output with the given [`CompressorOxide`]. |

## Functions

### `deflate`

```rust
fn deflate(compressor: &mut crate::deflate::core::CompressorOxide, input: &[u8], output: &mut [u8], flush: crate::MZFlush) -> crate::StreamResult
```

Try to compress from input to output with the given [`CompressorOxide`](../core/index.md).

# Errors

Returns [`MZError::Buf`](../../index.md) If the size of the `output` slice is empty or no progress was made due
to lack of expected input data, or if called without [`MZFlush::Finish`](../../index.md) after the compression
was already finished.

Returns [`MZError::Param`](../../index.md) if the compressor parameters are set wrong.

Returns [`MZError::Stream`](../../index.md) when lower-level decompressor returns a
[`TDEFLStatus::PutBufFailed`](../../index.md); may not actually be possible.
