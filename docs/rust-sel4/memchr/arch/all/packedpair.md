## memchr::arch::all::packedpair::Finder

*Struct*

An architecture independent "packed pair" finder.

This finder picks two bytes that it believes have high predictive power for
indicating an overall match of a needle. At search time, it reports offsets
where the needle could match based on whether the pair of bytes it chose
match.

This is architecture independent because it utilizes `memchr` to find the
occurrence of one of the bytes in the pair, and then checks whether the
second byte matches. If it does, in the case of [`Finder::find_prefilter`],
the location at which the needle could match is returned.

It is generally preferred to use architecture specific routines for a
"packed pair" prefilter, but this can be a useful fallback when the
architecture independent routines are unavailable.

**Methods:**

- `fn new(needle: &[u8]) -> Option<Finder>` - Create a new prefilter that reports possible locations where the given
- `fn with_pair(needle: &[u8], pair: Pair) -> Option<Finder>` - Create a new prefilter using the pair given.
- `fn find_prefilter(self: &Self, haystack: &[u8]) -> Option<usize>` - Run this finder on the given haystack as a prefilter.
- `fn pair(self: &Self) -> &Pair` - Returns the pair of offsets (into the needle) used to check as a

## memchr::arch::all::packedpair::HeuristicFrequencyRank

*Trait*

This trait allows the user to customize the heuristic used to determine the
relative frequency of a given byte in the dataset being searched.

The use of this trait can have a dramatic impact on performance depending
on the type of data being searched. The details of why are explained in the
docs of [`crate::memmem::Prefilter`]. To summarize, the core algorithm uses
a prefilter to quickly identify candidate matches that are later verified
more slowly. This prefilter is implemented in terms of trying to find
`rare` bytes at specific offsets that will occur less frequently in the
dataset. While the concept of a `rare` byte is similar for most datasets,
there are some specific datasets (like binary executables) that have
dramatically different byte distributions. For these datasets customizing
the byte frequency heuristic can have a massive impact on performance, and
might even need to be done at runtime.

The default implementation of `HeuristicFrequencyRank` reads from the
static frequency table defined in `src/memmem/byte_frequencies.rs`. This
is optimal for most inputs, so if you are unsure of the impact of using a
custom `HeuristicFrequencyRank` you should probably just use the default.

    memmem::FinderBuilder,

## memchr::arch::all::packedpair::Pair

*Struct*

A pair of byte offsets into a needle to use as a predicate.

This pair is used as a predicate to quickly filter out positions in a
haystack in which a needle cannot match. In some cases, this pair can even
be used in vector algorithms such that the vector algorithm only switches
over to scalar code once this pair has been found.

A pair of offsets can be used in both substring search implementations and
in prefilters. The former will report matches of a needle in a haystack
where as the latter will only report possible matches of a needle.

The offsets are limited each to a maximum of 255 to keep memory usage low.
Moreover, it's rarely advantageous to create a predicate using offsets
greater than 255 anyway.

The only guarantee enforced on the pair of offsets is that they are not
equivalent. It is not necessarily the case that `index1 < index2` for
example. By convention, `index1` corresponds to the byte in the needle
that is believed to be most the predictive. Note also that because of the
requirement that the indices be both valid for the needle used to build
the pair and not equal, it follows that a pair can only be constructed for
needles with length at least 2.

**Methods:**

- `fn new(needle: &[u8]) -> Option<Pair>` - Create a new pair of offsets from the given needle.
- `fn with_ranker<R>(needle: &[u8], ranker: R) -> Option<Pair>` - Create a new pair of offsets from the given needle and ranker.
- `fn with_indices(needle: &[u8], index1: u8, index2: u8) -> Option<Pair>` - Create a new pair using the offsets given for the needle given.
- `fn index1(self: &Self) -> u8` - Returns the first offset of the pair.
- `fn index2(self: &Self) -> u8` - Returns the second offset of the pair.
