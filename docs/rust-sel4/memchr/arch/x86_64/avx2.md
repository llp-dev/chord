## Module: memchr

This module defines 256-bit vector implementations of `memchr` and friends.

The main types in this module are [`One`], [`Two`] and [`Three`]. They are for
searching for one, two or three distinct bytes, respectively, in a haystack.
Each type also has corresponding double ended iterators. These searchers are
typically much faster than scalar routines accomplishing the same task.

The `One` searcher also provides a [`One::count`] routine for efficiently
counting the number of times a single byte occurs in a haystack. This is
useful, for example, for counting the number of lines in a haystack. This
routine exists because it is usually faster, especially with a high match
count, then using [`One::find`] repeatedly. ([`OneIter`] specializes its
`Iterator::count` implementation to use this routine.)

Only one, two and three bytes are supported because three bytes is about
the point where one sees diminishing returns. Beyond this point and it's
probably (but not necessarily) better to just use a simple `[bool; 256]` array
or similar. However, it depends mightily on the specific work-load and the
expected match frequency.



## Module: packedpair

A 256-bit vector implementation of the "packed pair" SIMD algorithm.

The "packed pair" algorithm is based on the [generic SIMD] algorithm. The main
difference is that it (by default) uses a background distribution of byte
frequencies to heuristically select the pair of bytes to search for.
