# num_bigint

Big Integer Types for Rust

* A [`BigUint`] is unsigned and represented as a vector of digits.
* A [`BigInt`] is signed and is a combination of [`BigUint`] and [`Sign`].

Common numerical operations are overloaded, so we can treat them
the same way we treat other numbers.

## Example

```rust
# fn main() {
use num_bigint::BigUint;
use num_traits::One;

// Calculate large fibonacci numbers.
fn fib(n: usize) -> BigUint {
    let mut f0 = BigUint::ZERO;
    let mut f1 = BigUint::one();
    for _ in 0..n {
        let f2 = f0 + &f1;
        f0 = f1;
        f1 = f2;
    }
    f0
}

// This is a very large number.
println!("fib(1000) = {}", fib(1000));
# }
```

It's easy to generate large random numbers:

```rust,ignore
use num_bigint::{ToBigInt, RandBigInt};

let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
let a = rng.gen_bigint(1000);

let low = -10000.to_bigint().unwrap();
let high = 10000.to_bigint().unwrap();
let b = rng.gen_bigint_range(&low, &high);

// Probably an even larger number.
println!("{}", a * b);
```

See the "Features" section for instructions for enabling random number generation.

## Features

The `std` crate feature is enabled by default, which enables [`std::error::Error`]
implementations and some internal use of floating point approximations. This can be disabled by
depending on `num-bigint` with `default-features = false`. Either way, the `alloc` crate is
always required for heap allocation of the `BigInt`/`BigUint` digits.

### Random Generation

`num-bigint` supports the generation of random big integers when the `rand`
feature is enabled. To enable it include rand as

```toml
rand = "0.8"
num-bigint = { version = "0.4", features = ["rand"] }
```

Note that you must use the version of `rand` that `num-bigint` is compatible
with: `0.8`.

### Arbitrary Big Integers

`num-bigint` supports `arbitrary` and `quickcheck` features to implement
[`arbitrary::Arbitrary`] and [`quickcheck::Arbitrary`], respectively, for both `BigInt` and
`BigUint`. These are useful for fuzzing and other forms of randomized testing.

### Serialization

The `serde` feature adds implementations of [`Serialize`][serde::Serialize] and
[`Deserialize`][serde::Deserialize] for both `BigInt` and `BigUint`. Their serialized data is
generated portably, regardless of platform differences like the internal digit size.


## Compatibility

The `num-bigint` crate is tested for rustc 1.60 and greater.
