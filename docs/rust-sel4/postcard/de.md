## Module: flavors

# Deserialization Flavors

"Flavors" in `postcard` are used as modifiers to the serialization or deserialization
process. Flavors typically modify one or both of the following:

1. The source medium of the deserialization, e.g. whether the data is serialized from a `[u8]` slice, or some other container
2. The format of the deserialization, such as if the original data is encoded in a COBS format, contains a CRC32 checksum
   appended to the message, etc.

Flavors are implemented using the [`Flavor`] trait, which acts as a "middleware" for retrieving the bytes before they
are passed to `serde` for deserialization

Multiple flavors may be combined to obtain a desired combination of behavior and storage.
When flavors are combined, it is expected that the storage flavor (such as [`Slice`]) is the innermost flavor.

Custom flavors may be defined by users of the `postcard` crate, however some commonly useful flavors have been provided in
this module. If you think your custom flavor would be useful to others, PRs adding flavors are very welcome!

## Usability

Flavors may not always be convenient to use directly, as they may expose some implementation details of how the
inner workings of the flavor behaves. It is typical to provide a convenience method for using a flavor, to prevent
the user from having to specify generic parameters, setting correct initialization values, or handling the output of
the flavor correctly. See `postcard::from_bytes()` for an example of this.

## When to use (multiple) flavors

Combining flavors are nice for convenience, as they perform potentially multiple steps of
serialization at one time.

This can often be more memory efficient, as intermediate buffers are not typically required.

## When NOT to use (multiple) flavors

The downside of passing deserialization through multiple steps is that it is typically slower than
performing each step serially. Said simply, "cobs decoding while deserializing" is often slower
than "cobs decode then deserialize", due to the ability to handle longer "runs" of data in each
stage. The downside is that if these stages can not be performed in-place on the buffer, you
will need additional buffers for each stage.

Additionally, deserializating flavors can be more restrictive or difficult to work with than
serialization flavors, as deserialization may require that the deserialized types borrow some
portion of the original message.

## Examples

### Using a single flavor

In the first example, we use the `Slice` flavor, to retrieve the serialized output from a `[u8]` slice.
No other modification is made to the serialization process.

```rust
use postcard::{
    de_flavors::Slice,
    Deserializer,
};
use serde::Deserialize;

#[derive(Deserialize, Debug, PartialEq)]
struct Tup(u8, u8, u8);

let msg = [0x04, 0x00, 0x04, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03];
let slice = Slice::new(&msg);
let mut deserializer = Deserializer::from_flavor(slice);
let t = Tup::deserialize(&mut deserializer).unwrap();
assert_eq!(t, Tup(4, 0, 4));
let remainder = deserializer.finalize().unwrap();
assert_eq!(remainder, &[1, 2, 3]);
```



## postcard::de::from_bytes

*Function*

Deserialize a message of type `T` from a byte slice. The unused portion (if any)
of the byte slice is not returned.

```rust
fn from_bytes<'a, T>(s: &'a [u8]) -> crate::error::Result<T>
```



## postcard::de::from_bytes_cobs

*Function*

Deserialize a message of type `T` from a cobs-encoded byte slice.

The unused portion (if any) of the byte slice is not returned.
The used portion of the input slice is modified during deserialization (even if an error is returned).
Therefore, if this is not desired, pass a clone of the original slice.

```rust
fn from_bytes_cobs<'a, T>(s: &'a  mut [u8]) -> crate::error::Result<T>
```



## postcard::de::take_from_bytes

*Function*

Deserialize a message of type `T` from a byte slice. The unused portion (if any)
of the byte slice is returned for further usage

```rust
fn take_from_bytes<'a, T>(s: &'a [u8]) -> crate::error::Result<(T, &'a [u8])>
```



## postcard::de::take_from_bytes_cobs

*Function*

Deserialize a message of type `T` from a cobs-encoded byte slice.

The unused portion (if any) of the byte slice is returned for further usage.
The used portion of the input slice is modified during deserialization (even if an error is returned).
Therefore, if this is not desired, pass a clone of the original slice.

```rust
fn take_from_bytes_cobs<'a, T>(s: &'a  mut [u8]) -> crate::error::Result<(T, &'a  mut [u8])>
```
