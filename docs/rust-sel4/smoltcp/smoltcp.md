## Module: config



## Module: iface

 Network interface logic.

The `iface` module deals with the *network interfaces*. It filters incoming frames,
provides lookup and caching of hardware addresses, and handles management packets.



## Module: phy

 Access to networking hardware.

The `phy` module deals with the *network devices*. It provides a trait
for transmitting and receiving frames, [Device](trait.Device.html)
and implementations of it:

  * the [_loopback_](struct.Loopback.html), for zero dependency testing;
  * _middleware_ [Tracer](struct.Tracer.html) and
    [FaultInjector](struct.FaultInjector.html), to facilitate debugging;
  * _adapters_ [RawSocket](struct.RawSocket.html) and
    [TunTapInterface](struct.TunTapInterface.html), to transmit and receive frames
    on the host OS.
# Examples

An implementation of the [Device](trait.Device.html) trait for a simple hardware
Ethernet controller could look as follows:

```rust
use smoltcp::phy::{self, DeviceCapabilities, Device, Medium};
use smoltcp::time::Instant;

struct StmPhy {
    rx_buffer: [u8; 1536],
    tx_buffer: [u8; 1536],
}

impl<'a> StmPhy {
    fn new() -> StmPhy {
        StmPhy {
            rx_buffer: [0; 1536],
            tx_buffer: [0; 1536],
        }
    }
}

impl phy::Device for StmPhy {
    type RxToken<'a> = StmPhyRxToken<'a> where Self: 'a;
    type TxToken<'a> = StmPhyTxToken<'a> where Self: 'a;

    fn receive(&mut self, _timestamp: Instant) -> Option<(Self::RxToken<'_>, Self::TxToken<'_>)> {
        Some((StmPhyRxToken(&mut self.rx_buffer[..]),
              StmPhyTxToken(&mut self.tx_buffer[..])))
    }

    fn transmit(&mut self, _timestamp: Instant) -> Option<Self::TxToken<'_>> {
        Some(StmPhyTxToken(&mut self.tx_buffer[..]))
    }

    fn capabilities(&self) -> DeviceCapabilities {
        let mut caps = DeviceCapabilities::default();
        caps.max_transmission_unit = 1536;
        caps.max_burst_size = Some(1);
        caps.medium = Medium::Ethernet;
        caps
    }
}

struct StmPhyRxToken<'a>(&'a mut [u8]);

impl<'a> phy::RxToken for StmPhyRxToken<'a> {
    fn consume<R, F>(self, f: F) -> R
        where F: FnOnce(& [u8]) -> R
    {
        // TODO: receive packet into buffer
        let result = f(&self.0);
        println!("rx called");
        result
    }
}

struct StmPhyTxToken<'a>(&'a mut [u8]);

impl<'a> phy::TxToken for StmPhyTxToken<'a> {
    fn consume<R, F>(self, len: usize, f: F) -> R
        where F: FnOnce(&mut [u8]) -> R
    {
        let result = f(&mut self.0[..len]);
        println!("tx called {}", len);
        // TODO: send packet out
        result
    }
}
```



## Module: socket

 Communication between endpoints.

The `socket` module deals with *network endpoints* and *buffering*.
It provides interfaces for accessing buffers of data, and protocol state machines
for filling and emptying these buffers.

The programming interface implemented here differs greatly from the common Berkeley socket
interface. Specifically, in the Berkeley interface the buffering is implicit:
the operating system decides on the good size for a buffer and manages it.
The interface implemented by this module uses explicit buffering: you decide on the good
size for a buffer, allocate it, and let the networking stack use it.



## Module: storage

 Specialized containers.

The `storage` module provides containers for use in other modules.
The containers support both pre-allocated memory, without the `std`
or `alloc` crates being available, and heap-allocated memory.



## Module: time

 Time structures.

The `time` module contains structures used to represent both
absolute and relative time.

 - [Instant] is used to represent absolute time.
 - [Duration] is used to represent relative time.

[Instant]: struct.Instant.html
[Duration]: struct.Duration.html



## Module: wire

 Low-level packet access and construction.

The `wire` module deals with the packet *representation*. It provides two levels
of functionality.

 * First, it provides functions to extract fields from sequences of octets,
   and to insert fields into sequences of octets. This happens `Packet` family of
   structures, e.g. [EthernetFrame] or [Ipv4Packet].
 * Second, in cases where the space of valid field values is much smaller than the space
   of possible field values, it provides a compact, high-level representation
   of packet data that can be parsed from and emitted into a sequence of octets.
   This happens through the `Repr` family of structs and enums, e.g. [ArpRepr] or [Ipv4Repr].

[EthernetFrame]: struct.EthernetFrame.html
[Ipv4Packet]: struct.Ipv4Packet.html
[ArpRepr]: enum.ArpRepr.html
[Ipv4Repr]: struct.Ipv4Repr.html

The functions in the `wire` module are designed for use together with `-Cpanic=abort`.

The `Packet` family of data structures guarantees that, if the `Packet::check_len()` method
returned `Ok(())`, then no accessor or setter method will panic; however, the guarantee
provided by `Packet::check_len()` may no longer hold after changing certain fields,
which are listed in the documentation for the specific packet.

The `Packet::new_checked` method is a shorthand for a combination of `Packet::new_unchecked`
and `Packet::check_len`.
When parsing untrusted input, it is *necessary* to use `Packet::new_checked()`;
so long as the buffer is not modified, no accessor will fail.
When emitting output, though, it is *incorrect* to use `Packet::new_checked()`;
the length check is likely to succeed on a zeroed buffer, but fail on a buffer
filled with data from a previous packet, such as when reusing buffers, resulting
in nondeterministic panics with some network devices but not others.
The buffer length for emission is not calculated by the `Packet` layer.

In the `Repr` family of data structures, the `Repr::parse()` method never panics
as long as `Packet::new_checked()` (or `Packet::check_len()`) has succeeded, and
the `Repr::emit()` method never panics as long as the underlying buffer is exactly
`Repr::buffer_len()` octets long.

# Examples

To emit an IP packet header into an octet buffer, and then parse it back:

```rust
# #[cfg(feature = "proto-ipv4")]
# {
use smoltcp::phy::ChecksumCapabilities;
use smoltcp::wire::*;
let repr = Ipv4Repr {
    src_addr:    Ipv4Address::new(10, 0, 0, 1),
    dst_addr:    Ipv4Address::new(10, 0, 0, 2),
    next_header: IpProtocol::Tcp,
    payload_len: 10,
    hop_limit:   64,
};
let mut buffer = vec![0; repr.buffer_len() + repr.payload_len];
{ // emission
    let mut packet = Ipv4Packet::new_unchecked(&mut buffer);
    repr.emit(&mut packet, &ChecksumCapabilities::default());
}
{ // parsing
    let packet = Ipv4Packet::new_checked(&buffer)
                            .expect("truncated packet");
    let parsed = Ipv4Repr::parse(&packet, &ChecksumCapabilities::default())
                          .expect("malformed packet");
    assert_eq!(repr, parsed);
}
# }
```
